def load_and_preprocess_images(image_path_list):
    """
    A quick start function to load and preprocess images for model input.
    This assumes the images should have the same shape for easier batching, but our model can also work well with different shapes.

    Args:
        image_path_list (list): List of paths to image files

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Batched tensor of preprocessed images with shape (N, 3, H, W)

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty

    Notes:
        - Images with different dimensions will be padded with white (value=1.0)
        - A warning is printed when images have different shapes
        - The function ensures width=518px while maintaining aspect ratio
        - Height is adjusted to be divisible by 14 for compatibility with model requirements
