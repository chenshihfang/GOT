## Overview

Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT, CVPR 2025) is a feed-forward neural network that directly infers all key 3D attributes of a scene, including extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters, point maps, depth maps, and 3D point tracks, **from one, a few, or hundreds of its views, within seconds**.


## Quick Start

First, clone this repository to your local machine, and install the dependencies (torch, torchvision, numpy, Pillow, and huggingface_hub). 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/vggt.git 
cd vggt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Now, try the model with just a few lines of code:

```python
import torch
from vggt.models.vggt import VGGT
from vggt.utils.load_fn import load_and_preprocess_images

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
# bfloat16 is supported on Ampere GPUs (Compute Capability 8.0+) 
dtype = torch.bfloat16 if torch.cuda.get_device_capability()[0] >= 8 else torch.float16

# Initialize the model and load the pretrained weights.
# This will automatically download the model weights the first time it's run, which may take a while.
model = VGGT.from_pretrained("facebook/VGGT-1B").to(device)

# Load and preprocess example images (replace with your own image paths)
image_names = ["path/to/imageA.png", "path/to/imageB.png", "path/to/imageC.png"]  
images = load_and_preprocess_images(image_names).to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(dtype=dtype):
        # Predict attributes including cameras, depth maps, and point maps.
        predictions = model(images)
```

The model weights will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face. If you encounter issues such as slow loading, you can manually download them [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/blob/main/model.pt) and load, or:

```python
model = VGGT()
_URL = "https://huggingface.co/facebook/VGGT-1B/resolve/main/model.pt"
model.load_state_dict(torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url(_URL))
```

## Detailed Usage

You can also optionally choose which attributes (branches) to predict, as shown below. This achieves the same result as the example above. This example uses a batch size of 1 (processing a single scene), but it naturally works for multiple scenes.

```python
from vggt.utils.pose_enc import pose_encoding_to_extri_intri
from vggt.utils.geometry import unproject_depth_map_to_point_map

with torch.no_grad():
    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast(dtype=dtype):
        images = images[None]  # add batch dimension
        aggregated_tokens_list, ps_idx = model.aggregator(images)
                
    # Predict Cameras
    pose_enc = model.camera_head(aggregated_tokens_list)[-1]
    # Extrinsic and intrinsic matrices, following OpenCV convention (camera from world)
    extrinsic, intrinsic = pose_encoding_to_extri_intri(pose_enc, images.shape[-2:])

    # Predict Depth Maps
    depth_map, depth_conf = model.depth_head(aggregated_tokens_list, images, ps_idx)

    # Predict Point Maps
    point_map, point_conf = model.point_head(aggregated_tokens_list, images, ps_idx)
        
    # Construct 3D Points from Depth Maps and Cameras
    # which usually leads to more accurate 3D points than point map branch
    point_map_by_unprojection = unproject_depth_map_to_point_map(depth_map.squeeze(0), 
                                                                extrinsic.squeeze(0), 
                                                                intrinsic.squeeze(0))

    # Predict Tracks
    # choose your own points to track, with shape (N, 2) for one scene
    query_points = torch.FloatTensor([[100.0, 200.0], 
                                        [60.72, 259.94]]).to(device)
    track_list, vis_score, conf_score = model.track_head(aggregated_tokens_list, images, ps_idx, query_points=query_points[None])
```

Furthermore, if certain pixels in the input frames are unwanted (e.g., sea, glass), you can mask them by setting the corresponding pixel values to 0 or 1, and then pass the masked images to the model.


## Visualization

We provide multiple ways to visualize your 3D reconstructions and tracking results. Before using these visualization tools, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_demo.txt
```

### Interactive 3D Visualization

**Please note:** VGGT typically reconstructs a scene in less than 1 second. However, visualizing 3D points may take tens of seconds due to third-party rendering, independent of VGGT's processing time. The visualization is slow especially when the number of images is large.


#### Gradio Web Interface

Our Gradio-based interface allows you to upload images/videos, run reconstruction, and interactively explore the 3D scene in your browser. You can launch this in your local machine or try it on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/vggt).


```bash
python demo_gradio.py
```

#### Viser 3D Viewer

Run the following command to run reconstruction and visualize the point clouds in viser. Note this script requires a path to a folder containing images. It assumes only image files under the folder. You can set `--use_point_map` to use the point cloud from the point map branch, instead of the depth-based point cloud.

```bash
python demo_viser.py --image_folder path/to/your/images/folder
```


### Track Visualization

To visualize point tracks across multiple images:

```python
from vggt.utils.visual_track import visualize_tracks_on_images
track = track_list[-1]
visualize_tracks_on_images(images, track, (conf_score>0.2) & (vis_score>0.2), out_dir="track_visuals")
```
This plots the tracks on the images and saves them to the specified output directory. 


## Single-view Reconstruction

Our model shows surprisingly good performance on single-view reconstruction, although it was never trained for this task. The model does not need to duplicate the single-view image to a pair, instead, it can directly infer the 3D structure from the tokens of the single view image. Feel free to try it with our demos above, which naturally works for single-view reconstruction.


## Runtime and GPU Memory

We benchmark the runtime and GPU memory usage of VGGT's aggregator on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU across various input sizes. 

| **Input Frames** | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 10 | 20 | 50 | 100 | 200 |
|:----------------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---:|:---:|
| **Time (s)**     | 0.04 | 0.05 | 0.07 | 0.11 | 0.14 | 0.31 | 1.04 | 3.12 | 8.75 |
| **Memory (GB)**  | 1.88 | 2.07 | 2.45 | 3.23 | 3.63 | 5.58 | 11.41 | 21.15 | 40.63 |

Note that these results were obtained using Flash Attention 3, which is faster than the default Flash Attention 2 implementation while maintaining almost the same memory usage. Feel free to compile Flash Attention 3 from source to get better performance.
